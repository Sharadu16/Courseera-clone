# info :
Coursera was founded in 2012[10] by Stanford University computer science professors Andrew Ng[11] and Daphne Koller.[12] Ng and Koller started offering their Stanford courses online in fall 2011,[13] and soon after left Stanford to launch Coursera. Princeton, Stanford, the University of Michigan and the University of Pennsylvania were the first universities to offer content on the platform.[14] Offerings have since expanded to include Specializations – collections of courses that build skills in a specific subject – as well as degrees and a workforce development product for businesses and government organizations.
